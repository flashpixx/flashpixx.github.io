A more leisure project is the [text mining-grouping](https://flashpixx.shinyapps.io/TextMining-Grouping/) than R Shiny application. The [source code](https://github.com/flashpixx/TextMining-Grouping) is an R application that uses the [normalized compression distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_compression_distance) to convert the text data into a distance matrix and then uses the [affinity propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_propagation) to convert it into a visual representation.
The idea for this procedure was generated from the project [SocialCars](https://www.socialcars.org/home.html) in order to get a visual impression of the different [research projects](https://www.socialcars.org/researchprofile.html) and their relationship to each other on the basis of the textual representation.
