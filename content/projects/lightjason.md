The research project [LightJason](http://lightjason.org) will be the result of my PhD in the field of[multi-agent systems](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiagentensystem). Multi-agent systems are an area of (weak) artificial intelligence. The goal of this work is to _human behavior_ in software and to use AI algorithms. The concept of [Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent) should represent a single individual or a part of the individual. 

Since such systems are initially designed using classical logic, one goal of my work was the application of _unsharp structures_ as [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic). Another important requirement was the scalability of such algorithms for _complex systems_. Thus my dissertation bridges the gap between classical logic, multi-valued logic, high-scalability, machine learning and current software architecture such as an asynchronous [event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) execution model or application within a [service-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) for web applications, as well as application within simulation environments.
